## Usage Guide

### Text Analysis

1. **Enter Text**: Type or paste text into the main text area
2. **Select Sample**: Choose from pre-loaded examples in the sidebar
3. **Click Analyze**: Press the "üîç Analyze Text" button to start processing
4. **Review Results**: Navigate through the tabbed results to see detailed analysis

### Audio Analysis

1. **Upload Audio**: Click "Browse files" and select a WAV, MP3, or M4A file
2. **Automatic Conversion**: The system will convert speech to text
3. **Analysis**: The converted text will be automatically analyzed
4. **Results**: View the same comprehensive analysis as text input

### Understanding Results

#### Preprocessing Tab
- Shows original and cleaned text
- Displays processed tokens after stopword removal and lemmatization

#### Sentiment Tab
- VADER sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound)
- Overall sentiment classification with confidence scores

#### Emotion Tab
- Dominant emotion detected using Hugging Face models
- Confidence score for the detected emotion
- Supports: joy, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust, neutral

#### Tone Tab
- Analysis of communication tone patterns
- Scores for: aggressive, confident, tentative, analytical, emotional
- Punctuation analysis (exclamations, questions, caps)

#### Flags Tab
- Red flags: Concerning behavioral patterns
- Green flags: Positive communication indicators
- Overall assessment: Red Flag, Green Flag, Mixed, or Neutral

#### Summary Tab
- Consolidated view of all analysis results
- Recommendations based on detected patterns
- Key metrics and assessment overview

## Technical Details

### Sentiment Analysis
Uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis, which is specifically designed for social media text and handles:
- Punctuation emphasis
- Capitalization
- Emoticons and slang
- Negation handling

### Emotion Detection
Employs the `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base` model from Hugging Face, which:
- Predicts Ekman's 6 basic emotions plus neutral
- Trained on diverse datasets for robust performance
- Provides confidence scores for predictions

### Tone Analysis
Implements a heuristic-based approach that analyzes:
- Word choice patterns
- Punctuation usage
- Capitalization patterns
- Linguistic markers for different tones

### Flag Detection
Rule-based system that combines:
- Sentiment analysis results
- Emotion detection outcomes
- Tone analysis findings
- Combinatorial pattern recognition
